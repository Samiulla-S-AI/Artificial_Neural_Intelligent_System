Q: types of error
A: Okay, here's a quick overview of common error types in Python:

**1. Syntax Errors:**

*   **What:** Occur when Python can't understand your code because it violates the language's grammar rules.
*   **Example:** `print("Hello)` (missing closing quote) or `if x = 5:` (should be `==` for comparison).
*   **Key Point:**  These are usually caught *before* the program runs. The interpreter will point out the line with the issue.

**2. Runtime Errors (Exceptions):**

*   **What:** Occur *during* program execution when something unexpected happens.
*   **Example:**
    *   `TypeError`:  Performing an operation on incompatible data types (e.g., adding a string to an integer).
    *   `NameError`:  Using a variable that hasn't been defined.
    *   `IndexError`:  Trying to access an index that's out of bounds in a list.
    *   `ValueError`:  Passing an inappropriate value to a function (e.g., `int("abc")`).
    *   `ZeroDivisionError`: Dividing by zero.
    *   `FileNotFoundError`: Attempting to open a file that doesn't exist.
*   **Key Point:**  Exceptions can be handled using `try...except` blocks to prevent the program from crashing.

**3. Logical Errors:**

*   **What:** The program runs without crashing, but it doesn't produce the intended result.  This is due to a flaw in the program's logic/algorithm.
*   **Example:**  Using `+` instead of `*` when calculating the area of a rectangle, or having an incorrect condition in an `if` statement.
*   **Key Point:** These are the hardest to find because Python doesn't tell you anything is wrong. You need careful testing and debugging to identify them.

**In summary:**

*   **Syntax:**  Grammar mistakes.  Caught before running.
*   **Runtime:** Errors *during* execution (exceptions). Can be handled.
*   **Logical:** Program runs but gives wrong answers. Hardest to debug.

Q: what is output def func(a,b=1) : rerurn a+b;  func(2) in python
A: The output of `func(2)` is 3.

Since `b` has a default value of 1, calling `func(2)` is equivalent to `func(2, 1)`, which returns 2 + 1.
