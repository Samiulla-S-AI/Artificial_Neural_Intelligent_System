Q: hi
A: Hi! Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to solve complex problems beyond classical computers.

**Key Points:**

*   **Qubits:** Instead of bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously (superposition).
*   **Superposition:** Allows quantum computers to explore many possibilities concurrently.
*   **Entanglement:** Correlates qubits, enabling complex computations.
*   **Applications:** Cryptography, drug discovery, materials science, optimization.

**Example:** Factoring large numbers (important for cryptography) is much faster on a quantum computer using Shor's algorithm.
